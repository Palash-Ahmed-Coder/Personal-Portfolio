Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player strategy game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking a space in the grid with their symbol (usually "X" or "O"). The objective is to be the first to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If all nine spaces are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw. It's a simple yet engaging game that helps develop critical thinking and strategy skills.
